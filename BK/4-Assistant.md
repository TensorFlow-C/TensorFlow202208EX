Category4
====================================================================== There are 5 questions in this exam with increasing difficulty from 1-5. Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score significantly less than your Category 5 question.  Don't use lambda layers in your model. You do not need them to solve the question. Lambda layers are not supported by the grading infrastructure.  You must use the Submit and Test button to submit your model at least once in this category before you finally submit your exam, otherwise you will score zero for this category. ======================================================================  NLP QUESTION  Build and train a classifier for the sarcasm dataset. The classifier should have a final layer with 1 neuron activated by sigmoid as shown. It will be tested against a number of sentences that the network hasn't previously seen and you will be scored on whether sarcasm was correctly detected in those sentences.
