Category2
====================================================================== There are 5 questions in this exam with increasing difficulty from 1-5. Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score significantly less than your Category 5 question.  Don't use lambda layers in your model. You do not need them to solve the question. Lambda layers are not supported by the grading infrastructure.  You must use the Submit and Test button to submit your model at least once in this category before you finally submit your exam, otherwise you will score zero for this category. ======================================================================  Basic Datasets Question  Create a classifier for the Fashion MNIST dataset Note that the test will expect it to classify 10 classes and that the input shape should be the native size of the Fashion MNIST dataset which is 28x28 monochrome. Do not resize the data. Your input layer should accept (28,28) as the input shape only. If you amend this, the tests will fail.
